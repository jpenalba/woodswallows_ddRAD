### Contents

* **Woodswallow_analysis.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing blocks of scripts to filter the fasta alignments for SNPs to be used in various analysis. It also contains the functions used to calculate the different population genetic paramaters. Finally, it contains the scripts used to plot the figures used in the manuscript.

* **demographic_analysis** - folder containing the .est and .tpl files of the different demographic scenarios that were input in fastsimcoal2

* **slim_simulations** - folder containing the .slim files used to simulate the different evolutionary processes in SLiM3.
